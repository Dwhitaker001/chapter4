# Write a program that uses nested loops to collect data and calculate the average rainfall over a
# period of years. The program should first ask for the number of years. The outer loop will iterate
# once for each year. The inner loop will iterate 12 times, once for each month. Each iteration of the
# inner loop will ask the user for the inches of rainfall for that month. After all iterations, the program
# should display the number of months, the total inches of rainfall, and the average rainfall per month
# for the entire period.

total = 0

years = int(input('How many years would you like to collect data for? '))
for year in range(years):

    for month in ['January', 'February', 'March', 'April', 'May', 'June', 'July', 'August', 'September', 'October', 'November', 'December']:
        inches = float(input('How much rainfall fell during the month of ' + month + '?'))
        total += inches
average = total/(years * 12)
print('The average amount of rainfall was', format(average, ',.2f'), 'inches')
print('The total amount of rainfall was', format(total, ',.2f'), 'inches')
